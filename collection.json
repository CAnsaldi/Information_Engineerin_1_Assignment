        "text": "logic and programming languages logic has been long in\n    terested in whether answers to certain questions are computable\n    in principle, since the outcome puts bounds on the\n    possibilities of formalization. more recently, precise\n    comparisons in the efficiency of decision methods have become\n    available through the developments in complexity theory. these,\n    however, are applications to logic, and a big question is\n    whether methods of logic have significance in the other\n    direction for the more applied parts of computability theory.\n    programming languages offer an obvious opportunity as their\n    syntactic formalization is well advanced; however, the\n    semantical theory can hardly be said to be complete. though we\n    have many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging\n    mathematical answers to these queries: what is a machine? what\n    is a computable process? how (or how well) does a machine\n    simulate a process? programs naturally enter in giving\n    descriptions of processes. the definition of the precise\n    meaning of a program then requires us to explain what are the\n    objects of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)\n    and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). so far the\n    theories of automata and of nets, though most in teresting for\n    dynamics, have formalized only a portion of the field, and\n    there has been perhaps too much concentration on the\n    finite-state and algebraic aspects. it would seem that the\n    understanding of higher-level program features involves us with\n    infinite objects and forces us to pass through several levels\n    of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to the final\n    simulation on a real machine. these levels can be made\n    mathematically exact if we can find the right abstractions to\n    represent the necessary structures. the experience of many\n    independent workers with the method of data types as lattices\n    (or partial orderings) under an information content ordering,\n    and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the\n    flexibility of this approach in providing definitions and\n    proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence on\n    implementations. nevertheless much remains to be done in\n    showing how abstract conceptualizations can (or cannot) be\n    actualized before we can say we have a unified theory.\n    september, 1977 scott, d. s. logic, programming languages,\n    automata, denotational semantics, a-calculus models,\n    computability, partial functions, approximation, function\n    spaces 1.2 4.20 5.21 5.24 5.27 ca770902 jb december 28, 1977\n    6:49 am"

(2) a message can be\n    \"signed\" using a privately held decryption key. anyone can\n    verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed\n    encryption key. signatures cannot be forged, and a signer\n    cannot later deny the validity of his signature. this has\n    obvious applications in \"electronic mail\" and \"electronic funds\n    transfer\" systems. a message is encrypted by representing it as\n    a number m, raising m to a publicly specified power e, and then\n    taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly\n    specified product, n, of two large secret prime numbers p and\n    q. decryption is similar;only a different, secret, power d is\n    used, where e * d = 1 (mod(p-1) * (q-1)). the security of the\n    system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the\n    published divisor, n. february, 1978 rivest, r.l. shamir, a.\n    adleman, l. digital signatures, public-key cryptosystems,\n    privacy, authentication, security, factorization, prime number,\n    electronic mail, message-passing, electronic funds transfer,\n    cryptography. 2.12 3.15 3.50 3.81 5.25 ca780202 jb march 28,\n    1978 4:40 pm"
